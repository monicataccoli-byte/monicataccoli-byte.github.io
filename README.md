## stardust to science

### stardust to science website concept and content
  I wanted to create a friendly, eye-catching aesthetic that wasn't convoluted with too much text or images. This was done in order to direct the user's focus by presenting it in a simple and bright manner. If you note it also reflects loosely on sites like Google or Ebay that are simple, friendly and attractive to use. I based the website on most of the instructions listed below. I also wanted to create my thought on branding using the "stardust to science" title as a pre-introduction to that brand for possible use later. 

 I am looking forward to building further on this first website. I feel that it may have the potential to be a brand and I would like to expand on the concept of stardust to science in a great deal more detail with the ideal to see it launch as I gain more knowledge, confidence and experience in coding, as my ideas on enhancing the website are not exhaustive.

The design decisions were based on simplicity and vivid colours to attract attention quickly and efficiently.  When using text, slogans, titles, etc when launching your message. In today's Western culture or even universally, I believe the most common strategies are being quick and efficient in grabbing attention when marketing a product. This is due to competing against multiples upon multiples of images, from advertising, marketing schemes etc already crowding our websites.  When using text, slogans, titles,etc to launch your message, creativity, uniqueness and quality  are (just a few of the many characteristics) required to stand out and this would require in-depth knowledge of the domestic and global markets of what may be next to trend! I have included most of the criteria below.

- At least one profile picture
- Biography (at least 100 words)
- Functional Contact Form
- "Projects" section
- Links to external sites, e.g. GitHub and LinkedIn.

### Design and technical specifications
 The design decisions were based on simplicity and using minimal vivid colours to attract attention quickly and efficiently when utilising text, slogans, titles,etc to launch your message. In today's Western culture or even universally, I believe the most common strategies are being quick and efficient in grabbing attention when marketing a product. To be honest I just let my imagination and natural curiousity flow when starting the design. Also I would like to state as per the above the examples of world famous and successul websites that are simple, carefree and friendly. I used the instructions below as a guideline for this project. The technical functions for this website were the use of html to create the text content and css for the styling to render the website possible to be viewed in a more aesthetically acceptable manner.

-  least 2 web pages.
-  Version controlled with Git
-  Deployed on GitHub pages.
-  Implements responsive design principles.
- Uses semantic HTML.

### Bonus (optional)
 I did add html and css cod to hover over the "home" and "contact" buttons by adding a different colour to the background.

-  Different styles for active, hover and focus states.
-  Include JavaScript to add some dynamic elements to your site. (Extra tricky!)

### Screenshots
> Please include the following: I was able to add a different feature on the contact page that I feel also was aligned with the look of the first page by embedding images that complemented each other in colour and continued to provide an effect of a friendly, welcoming website.

> - The different pages and features of your website on mobile, tablet and desktop screen sizes (multiple screenshots per page and screen size). Please see the attachments below for the images.
[hover over the contact button]

> - The different features of your site, e.g. if you have hover states, take a screenshot that shows that.  Please see screenshots attached.
> 
> You can do this by saving the images in a folder in your repo, and including them in your readme document with the following Markdown code:
