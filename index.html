        a little about me: my name is monica taccoli i usually look like a normal woman, but i'm secretly a wannabe nerd,
        closeted sci-fi writer, and full-time emotional support human to a few fluffy pomeranians
        with attachment issues (whether they're mine or theirs is still undecided).
